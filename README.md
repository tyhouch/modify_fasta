## modify_fasta Notebook ##

This notebook is intended to rename ID lines of a multifasta file based on an excel sheet that realtes accession IDs to variant names, but could be slightly modified to apply to another renaming purpose. 

We initially created this so our multifasta file could be processed and used to train a KEVOLVE model, initially developed to detect discriminatory motifs in HIV variants.
